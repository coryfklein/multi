# multi

`multi` is a tool for using `git grep` on multiple repositories at once. Often at work I have multiple repositories that are interrelated and I want to grep through all of them at once. This can now be done using `multi`.

# Install

`./install`

This will install `multi` into `$HOME/.local/bin`. If your `$PATH` references that directory then you will be able to use `multi` from the command line immediately. Otherwise add `$HOME/.local/bin` to your `$PATH` first.

Installing with flag `./install --global` will install `multi` into `usr/local/bin`, add `usr/local/bin` to your `$PATH` if it isn't already there.

This will also install a `.multi` configuration file in your home directory.

# Configuration

Before using `multi` for the first time you must specify the repositories to be searched in the `REPOS` variable in your `~/.multi` file.

# Example

```bash
$ cd ~/src
$ ls
vim spring-framework gradle phantomjs
$ multi -i "fantastic"
vim

# Uninstall

`./uninstall`

This will uninstall `multi` from `$HOME/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `$HOME/.multi` and `/etc/multi`.

Uninstalling with flag `./uninstall --exclude-local-config` will exclude `$HOME/.multi` from the uninstall.
